## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- Alpine.js


### What I learned

i'm used to convert design to markup, but in this challenge i really have a hard time adjusting this FAQ items, the layout always expanded when you click one of those items to see the detail, so i ends up giving the FAQ items div wrapper a static height, i'm not sure if this good practice but at least it works for now.
